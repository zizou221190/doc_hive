Welcome to Hive's documentation!
================================


`Apache Hive`_ is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop for providing data summarization, query, and analysis. Hive gives an SQL-like interface to query data stored in various databases and file systems that integrate with Hadoop. The traditional SQL queries must be implemented in the MapReduce Java API to execute SQL applications and queries over a distributed data. Hive provides the necessary SQL abstraction to integrate SQL-like Queries (HiveQL) into the underlying Java API without the need to implement queries in the low-level Java API. Since most of the data warehousing application work with SQL based querying language, Hive supports easy portability of SQL-based application to Hadoop
